#Train control system
Train control system is a Java project that involves creating a control system for a railway station or train depot. The project includes several entities such as Cargo, User, and different types of Carriages.

##Class Hierarchy and Inheritance
One of the key challenges of this project is designing the class hierarchy and inheritance relationships between the different entities. For example, a User with a ticket is a passenger, while a User with a license is a driver.

##Collections and Linked List
The project also involves implementing collections and defining a linked list class to connect the different carriages in a train.

##Testing and Logging
Tests are written for the various classes and methods in the project to ensure proper functionality. Logging will also be implemented to aid in debugging and tracking events within the system.

##Project Management
Maven is used for project management, including managing dependencies and building the project.
